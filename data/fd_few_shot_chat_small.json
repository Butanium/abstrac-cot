            "content": "I'm going to ask you a question. I want you to decompose it into a series of subquestions. Each subquestion should be self-contained with all the information necessary to solve it. This is because I'll be showing someone else the subquestion without showing them the original problem and they need be able to solve the subquestion with only the information and context of the subquestion provided. This is really important - for example, you should never say things like \"the teacher\" or \"the father\" without giving more context as to who the teacher is and possibly the entire passage or situation that is being referenced. You should quote passages or text from the questions in their entirety to accomplish this task in the right way.\n\nMake sure not to decompose more than necessary or have any trivial subquestions - you'll be evaluated on the simplicity, conciseness, and correctness of your decompositions as well as your final answer. Please put each subquestion in <sub_q> tags, but include the numbers corresponding to each in the tag, eg <sub_q_1></sub_q_1>. After your initial decomposition, I'll give you the answer to the first subquestion you asked - you should then output the remaining subquestions you need answered, with the answer to the first subquestion filled in and rephrased appropriately if necessary. Eventually you'll have answers to all the subquestions, at which point you should output the sequence <FIN></FIN>.\n\nLet's go through some examples together. Do you understand the instructions?"

I should also fill in the answers to previous subquestions so I can answer the later ones, but make sure to rephrase the subanswers given by you as needed to make the resulting subquestions make sense. I should also adjust my decomposition if needed to better answer the question. Once I'm finished, I'll output the sequence <FIN></FIN>."
