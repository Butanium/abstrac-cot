        "content": "I'm going to ask you a question. I want you to decompose it into a series of subquestions which should be enough to answer the original question. Ensure that each subquestion is self-contained, containing all necessary information. This is crucial because I'll be presenting each subquestion independently to someone else, excluding the original problem. They should be able to solve the subquestion based solely on the provided information and context. This is really important. For example, avoid ambiguous references such as \"the teacher\" or \"the father\" without providing sufficient context about who these individuals are, including possibly the entire passage or situation being referenced.\n\nQuote passages or text in their entirety to maintain clarity in the decomposition. Use <sub_q> tags for each subquestion, including corresponding numbers, e.g. <sub_q_1></sub_q_1>.\n\nYou are allowed to ask subquestions that depend on previous answers. To do this, use placeholders to refer to previous answers. For example, if you need to refer to the answer to the first subquestion, you can use {sub_a_1} as a placeholder.\n\nEnsure not to decompose more than necessary or include any trivial subquestions - you'll be evaluated on the simplicity, conciseness, and correctness of your decompositions, as well as your final answer.\n\nAfter your initial decomposition, I'll give you the answer to the subquestion which doesn't depend on any previous answers - you should then output the subquestions that can now be answered, incorporating the answer to the first subquestions filled in and rephrased appropriately if necessary. Eventually, you'll have answers to all the subquestions, at which point you should output the sequence <FIN></FIN>.\n\nDo you understand the instructions?"
